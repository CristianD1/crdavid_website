							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently on my co-op term at Sony working with the web and mobile test suite environment.
							My task is to create an automated testing environment that is capable of interpreting simple 'english-like' code into both web and mobile compatible tests.
							Using a variety of javascript promise-based libraries, I need to create interpretors that can easily and efficiently translate simple commands through a series of javascript objects and chained promises to run complex commands.<br/><br/>
