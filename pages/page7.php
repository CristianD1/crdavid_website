      I had been born into a less than extravagant family that had fewer coins than furniture. Considering our furniture consisted of a chair and a half bed, our wealth was evidently scarce. It was peaceful growing up, however, my spare time was taken up by visiting our local church and using what little resources we had to feed the less fortunate. I had but one problem for the better part of my life that was simply defined by my loneliness. This had not been a simple feeling of loneliness that bugged me once in a while, it was more of a creeping loneliness - one that gnawed at my bones and left me in a constant deafening silence.
