      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered the bare earth, built our own house, harvested our own crops and laid our own foundation to a perfect society. All in perfect isolation, we built the world from scratch. Our lives had improved drastically until once again, everything was crushed under the feet of others. Attacked and imprisoned by the new supposed ruler of the land we happened to be trespassing, our lives had taken a turn for the worse as we spent the next two years waiting for a trial in the lowest level of a castlesâ€™ dungeons. With the chance of surviving the trial under this new cold handed ruler being as low as our regard for society, we had given up all hope and have forgone any notion of salvation or existence of miracles. Within the week they had killed my friend, I had endless regrets of the things I had done that led him here. If I had not strayed from the path my parents set me on and tried to beat him, our entire lives would have been different. His path would have never crossed mine and as a result, he would have been a much more peaceful person. An ignorant carcass seems to be the happiest kind, and the one miracle that happened in my life had been my trial.
