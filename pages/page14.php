      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	After a terrifying deliberation on whether or not I should live, God had done his kindness in my name and had given grace. Whether or not this rest would be eternal was not mine to decide, but to the man that had been watching over me the entire time.</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my foot sunk into the clean crisp sand by the water lapping on the shore, all forms of wonderful sights and smells wrapped themselves around me, forcing themselves to be noticed. The ship behind me rocked gently as if it were as tired from the journey it had undergone as I had been. This land seemed too ethereal as the dim sunlight filtered through the trees and glazed the sand in a coating of warm yellow film. I reached out and fell, now knowing that no matter what, I was safe, and there would be someone to catch me.
